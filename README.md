# IMDB Movie Analysis  

## Objective  
This project analyzes the IMDB Movies dataset to uncover trends, popular genres, and factors influencing movie success. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis delivers actionable insights through comprehensive data exploration and visualization.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this analysis can be found in this repository files : imdb_movies.csv.  

## Tasks Covered  
### 1. **Project Setup and Data Loading**  
- Load and explore the dataset.  
- Understand the structure, size, and data types.  

### 2. **Data Overview and Cleaning**  
- Identified missing values and ensured correct data types.  
- Handled outliers to improve analysis accuracy.  

### 3. **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis**  
- Explored distributions of movie scores, budgets, and revenues.  
- Examined relationships between key variables like budget, revenue, and scores.  

### 4. **Genre-Specific Analysis**  
- Analyzed genre popularity and average scores.  
- Visualized how genre trends have changed over time.  

### 5. **Yearly and Decadal Trends**  
- Investigated how scores and movie releases have evolved over the years.  
- Examined patterns in decade-based movie production.  

### 6. **Insights and Summary**  
- Summarized key findings and identified trends in genres, ratings, and release patterns.  
- Suggested additional questions and data to explore further.  

## Tools and Libraries  
- **Python**: Primary programming language.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.  
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.  
- **Seaborn**: Advanced visualization and styling.  

## Key Findings  
- Action and adventure genres dominate modern trends, while older genres like westerns have declined.  
- High-budget movies generally have higher revenue, but strong storytelling drives critical acclaim.  
- Movie releases are strategically clustered around summer and holidays for maximum impact.

## Future Scope
- Analyze audience demographics to gain deeper insights into movie preferences.
- Explore streaming platform data to understand digital trends.
- Incorporate social media metrics to assess their impact on movie success.
